                                the side of server. The app had two parts: a user part where regular users could view
                                supply and demand, and the administrator, which allowed admins complete management
                                users, offers, requests and reviews.

                        I worked at SWproducts s.r.o., where my primary focus was on C#. I also worked with Microsoft
                        SQL Server for database management. In the area of web technologies, I used HTML, CSS, ASP.NET,

                        At AppOnFly, I gained experience with Linux, specifically in configuring virtualization. This
